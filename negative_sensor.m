%negative_sensor.m written 9-16-16 by JTN to compute the sensors for flux
%limiters when the velocity is negative.

%updated 8 - 25 - 17 by JTN for the more general (2d) case. Currently
%not incorporating BC

% The code is a little messy because points corresponding to x (or y) =
% delta x (i.e., the secon row / column) will sample incorrectly, so we
% need to find these points and assign them a value of -1 (assuming 0
% Neumann BC)

% function [r_e,r_w,r_w_m1,r_e_m0] = negative_sensor(u,int,bd_0_int,bd_nm1_int,step)
function [r_e,r_w] = negative_sensor(u,int,int_row_nm1,step)

    %initialize r_e to have right number of points
    r_e = zeros(length(int),1);

    %compute r_w no problem
    r_w = (u(int) - u(int+step))./(u(int-step) - u(int));
    
    
    %now remove interior points that will sample incorrectly before
    %calculating r_w
    int(int_row_nm1) = [];
    
    
    %For r_e, compute most points as normal (recall the problem points were
    %removed from int)
    r_e = (u(int+step) - u(int+2*step))./(u(int) - u(int+step));    
    
    %and now fix points that wound have sampled incorrectly
    %we are currently assuming a zero neumann BC
    r_e(int_row_nm1) = -1;
% 
% %     boundary
%     r_w_m1 = r_e(bd_nm1_int);
%     r_e_m0 = r_w(bd_0_int);
    
    %eliminate NaN values (0/0 -- not steep!)
    r_e(isnan(r_e)) = 1;
    r_w(isnan(r_w)) = 1;
%     r_w_m1(isnan(r_w_m1)) = 1;
%     r_e_m0(isnan(r_e_m0)) = 1;
%     
    %set inf values to large value
    r_e(isinf(r_e)) = 100;
    r_w(isinf(r_w)) = 100;
%     r_w_m1(isinf(r_w_m1)) = 100;
